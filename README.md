# TravelAgency

In this project, a web application has been developed for a travel agency, allowing the user to consult information on available trips, view and add reviews.

At the backend level it is developed using JavaScript under the NodeJS and Express frameworks, it uses a MySQL database with which it communicates through Sequelize as ORM.

The interface is a vanilla frontend (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), built without frameworks and using PUG as a template engine.
